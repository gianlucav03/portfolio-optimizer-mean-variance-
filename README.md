# Portfolio Optimizer (Mean-Variance)

This Python-based tool constructs efficient portfolios using mean-variance optimization.

It inputs historical asset data, calculates expected returns, volatilities, and covariances, and visualizes the efficient frontier. Users can identify portfolios that optimize for Sharpe ratio, minimum variance, or target return levels.

Built with `pandas`, `NumPy`, and `matplotlib`.
